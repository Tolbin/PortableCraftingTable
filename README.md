PortableCraftingTable
=====================

The commands are /pct and /wb.

/pct toggles if it's enabled for the player and /wb brings up the workbench.
Right clicking on a workbench in the inventory works as well.
/pct remembers if you have it enabled/disabled through logouts/reboots.

The permission to use all of this is "pct.use".
